<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>This is a journal of tips, shortcuts, solutions or anything that related to computer and technology that I encounter in my daily life.</p>
<p>It may takes some time to transfer all of my notes from DEVONThink to this site. I know DEVONThink is more powerful than this static markdown site, but it is only available to macOS and iOS. And because I'm using multiple operating systems, I want something that I can access on any platform that I'm currently using at that moment.</p>
<p>Also once everything is here, it is going to be hard to find things later on. I'm going to add the search function and also tags cloud soon.</p>
<ul class="posts">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> Â» <a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
