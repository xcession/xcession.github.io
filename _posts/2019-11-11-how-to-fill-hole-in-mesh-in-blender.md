**Blender** is useful to fill or mend a **hole** in a mesh. Holes are typically already present in a mesh or you create them while deleting elements of a mesh.

- Switch to `Edit Mode` and then click the `Vertex select mode` button. You are now ready to select vertices.
- Select the vertices that border the hole. To do this, keep the `Shift` key pressed down while you select the vertices by using the mouse button
- Press the `f` key to fill the hole. Blender tries to fill the hole with a suitable polygon. If you want to fill with triangles, then repeat these steps for every 3 vertices that form those triangles.
