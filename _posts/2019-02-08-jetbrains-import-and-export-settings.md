# Exporting and Importing Settings

WebStorm enables you to preserve and share your settings as a JAR archive. You can archive and store your preferred settings and use them for other IDE installations or make them available to your colleagues.

## Exporting settings to a JAR archive

- Choose **File > Export Settings** from the main menu.
- In the **Export Settings** dialog box that opens specify the settings to export by selecting the checkboxes next to them. By default, all settings are selected.
- In the **Export settings to** text box, specify the fully qualified name of the target archive. Type the path manually or click **Browse** and specify the target file in the dialog that opens.

## Importing settings from a JAR archive

- Choose **File > Import Settings** from the main menu.
- In the **Import File Location** dialog box that opens select the desired archive.
- In the **Select Components to Import** dialog box that opens specify the settings to be imported, and click **OK**. By default, all settings are selected.
