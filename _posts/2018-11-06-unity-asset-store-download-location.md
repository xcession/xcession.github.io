## Download The Unity Asset

> Unity is **required** to download Unity assets.

Once you have got Unity up and running, you can download the asset you have purchased by following this process:

- Open Unity Engine.
- Click "Window" > "Asset Store".
- Log in to your Unity account
- Find Asset.
- Download Asset.

Once you have downloaded your assets, they can be found in the following locations:

- **Windows** - `User>AppData>Roaming>Unity> Asset Store`

- **Mac** - `User>Library>Unity>Asset Store`

From these locations, you can drag and drop them into other projects, or even other engines if you wish to.
