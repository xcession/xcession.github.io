When you're using Linux with the GNOME UI, don't you hate it when you have to go to into the terminal or add the the force quit button to the panel just so you can exit an unresponsive program?

- Go to **System>Preferences>Keyboard Shortcuts**
- Scroll down to bottom of the list and click the "+" button and a window should come up with 2 text boxes, labeled "Name" and "Command".
- In "Name", type "**Force Quit**".
- And in the "Command" box, type "`xkill`" and press Apply.

In **Custom Shortcuts** section you'll see **Force Quit** on the left and **Disabled** on the right side. Click on **Disabled** once, and press a combination of keys on your keyboard. (For example `Super` (Windows logo) key and `Escape`).

> **Note:** If you find yourself to have accidentally pressed your force quit keys, then just `right click` and it'll close out of the force quit mode.
